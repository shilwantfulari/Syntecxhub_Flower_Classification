# 🌸 Flower Classification Project (Machine Learning)

**Internship Task 1 | Syntecxhub**

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at **Syntecxhub**. It demonstrates the end-to-end Machine Learning lifecycle by classifying Iris flowers into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) based on their physical measurements.

The solution includes:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature relationships using Seaborn.
* **Model Comparison:** Evaluating Logistic Regression vs. Decision Tree classifiers.
* **Interactive CLI:** A real-time command-line interface for user predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
* **Dataset:** Iris Dataset (Standard ML benchmark)

## 📊 Features
1.  **Data Visualization:** Automatically generates a Pair Plot to analyze feature correlations.
2.  **Model Performance:**
    * **Logistic Regression:** High accuracy (typically 95-100%).
    * **Decision Tree:** Comparable performance, prone to overfitting on small data.
3.  **Visual Evaluation:** Generates Confusion Matrices to show prediction errors.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shilwantfulari/Syntecxhub_Flower_Classification.git](https://github.com/shilwantfulari/Syntecxhub_Flower_Classification.git)
    cd Syntecxhub_Flower_Classification
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
